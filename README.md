# Note
You can also just add http://bleeper.eu to your repo list, this contains official releases and stable versions of packages you can also find here.

If packages are still in Beta you are most likely to find them here but it might not be as stable as the versions on there.
When you are not that known in testing and developing I recommend you don't install this repo but Bleeper instead.
